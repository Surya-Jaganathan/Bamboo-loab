# Bamboo-loab

Bambu Lab is a rapidly growing Chinese‑founded tech startup that has made waves in the desktop 3D printing space with machines that offer speed, automation, multi‑color capability, and a polished user experience. But, along with high praise, they face scrutiny over cloud dependency, firmware controls, and user freedom—especially from the open-source community.
